# Logical Dreams DevPage
Official Web Application for any developer or designer who wants to collaborate with my Game Studio's team. 

Any changes or new features you want to make for the project must be developed and tested in your own branch, 
approved by other developers and then pushed to the Dev branch for integrations with the whole site.

Plus, try to make subtle, tiny, maintanable and testable changes every time you upload something to this repo, 
for easier maintanace and readablity of what in the actual hell you just broke.... I mean, upload.

*I don't like this dummy-styleless readme, prettier changes will come in the future*
